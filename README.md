Contentful package for flutter, features included in the package:

âœ… Get entries

âœ… Get entry by Id

âœ… The Entry is a generic type and could be defined in any way

âœ… We implemented ContentfulFlutterBuilder so it saves you time to implement the widgets and the logic to return the article especially with bulleted and numbered lists.
